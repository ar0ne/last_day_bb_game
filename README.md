## Introducing

This is simple demo shooter game that I made when I was quite young on my "home hackaton". Usually, I took some language, or engine, or framework and tried to have fun with it.  

This game was written on [Blitz Basic](http://www.blitzbasic.com/) language. 

Total spend time - 2 days (include level design, etc.)

And, honestly, I don't understand this code anymore :D
